# WifiAlwaysOn
Android App that periodically checks and enables Wi-Fi (in case it was turned off)

This small app was created specially for my Toyota Camry Android Head Unit which is kinda buggy and doesn't always save Wifi state. 
I wrote this for my own needs and have it running on my HU for about a month with no bugs.
Warning! I didn't test the app thoroughly and have no idea how Toyota Dealer would react on this. SO PLEASE USE THIS APP AT YOUR OWN RISK! :)
