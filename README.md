# WifiAlwaysOn
Android App that autostarts and periodically checks and enables Wi-Fi (in case it was turned off)

## Disclamer
This small app was created specially for my Toyota Camry Android Head Unit which is kinda buggy and doesn't always save Wifi state. 
I wrote this for my own needs and have it running on my HU for about a month with no bugs.
Warning! I didn't test the app thoroughly and have no idea how Toyota Dealer would react on this.
**SO PLEASE USE THIS APP AT YOUR OWN RISK! :)**


## Installation Instructions

1) Build apk (I used Android Studio 2.3 but YMMV)
2) Install it as usual into your Android system.
3) Launch WifiAlwaysOn app from Application menu **at least on—Åe** after installing it.
4) Small icon (wifi with lock) will appear in notification area - your wifi is under protection from now on 8-)
